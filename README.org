* Introduction

=orkg= stands for [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph][knowledge graph]].

This package contains a set of functions that are useful for structuring information in a similar way that [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page][Wikidata]] use. If you don't know what [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page][Wikidata]] is, you can read [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction][this]]. In simple terms, every concept (from fruits, keyboard layouts to planets, animals, operating systems, etc.) is considered an entity and the characteristics of an entity are stored as key-value pairs. For example, here's the Wikidata entity for [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10817602][pineapple]], [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q159][Russia]], [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1252773][GNU Emacs]] and [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18968627][GNU Guix]].

Because [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org mode]] support key-value pairs, we can structure some information by using that approach.
